	cout<<"4	This room should be directly below 528?

3	Yeah.

1	Think, Mr. Fischer, think.

1	What do you remember from before this dream?

2	Oh... there was, um... there was a lot of gunfires.

2	Uncle Peter.

2	Oh my god, we've been kidnaped.

1	Where were they holding you?

2	Uh...

2	They had us in the back of a van.

1	That explains the gravity shifts.

1	You're in the back of a van right now.Ke...keep going!

2	It had something to do with, um... something to do with a... a safe.

2	God, why is it so hard to remember?

1	It's like trying to remember a dream after you've woken up.

1	Listen to this, it takes years of practice.

1	You and Browning have been pulled into this dream,

1	because they're trying to stealsomething from your mind.

1	I need you to focus and try to remember what that is.

1	What is it, Mr. Fischer? Think!

2	Uh... A combination.

2	They demanded the first numbers that popped into my head.

2	They were trying to extract the number from your subconscious.

1	It can represent anything.We are in a hotel right now.

1	Should try hotel rooms.What was the number, Mr. Fischer?

1	Try and remember for me.This is very important.

2	5...52... It was something long number...

1	That's good enough. We could start there.

1	Fifth floor.

3	So do you use a timer?

4	No, I have to judge it for myself.

4	While you're all asleep in 528.I wait for Yusuf's kick.

3	Well, how will you know?

4	His music warns me.

4	And then when the van hits the barrier of the bridge,

4	that should be unmistakable.So we get a nice, synchronized kick.

4	If it's too soon, we won't get pulled out.

4	And if it's too late, I won't be able to drop this.

3	Why not?

4	Because of the van that will be in free fall.

4	Can't drop be without gravity.

3	Right.

1	They're with me. Go on.

4	Mr. Charles.

1	Do you know what that is, Mr. Fischer?

2	Yeah, I... I think so. Yeah.

1	They were trying to put you under.

2	I'm already under.

1	Under again.

2	What do you mean?A... dream within a dream?

3	Hey, I see you've changed.

4	I'm sorry?

3	Oh... I'm sorry. I've mistaken you for a friend.

4	Oh. Good looking fella, I'm sure.

4	That's Fischer's projection of Browning.Let's follow him and see how he behaves.

3	Why?

4	Because how he acts would tell us...

4	if Fischer's starting to suspect his motives as the way we wanted to.

3	Shh...

2	Uncle Peter?

1	You said you were kidnaped together?

2	Well, um... well, not... not exactly.

2	They... they already had him.They were torturing him.

1	And you saw them torture him?

2	The kidnapers are working for you?

3	Oh, Robert...

2	You're trying to get that safe open? So you get the alternate will?

3	Fischer

3	Morrow has been my entire life.I can't let you destroy it.

3	I'm not gonna throw away my inheritance!Why would I?

3	I couldn't let you rise to your father's last taunt.

2	What taunt?

3	The will, Robert.

3	That will, that's his last insult, a challenge for you...

3	you'd build something for yourself,

3	by telling you you're not worthy of his accomplishments.

2	Well, that he was, um... disappointed.

3	Hmm, I'm sorry.

3	But... he's wrong.

3	You can build a better company than he ever did.

1	Mr. Fischer, he's lying.

2	How do you know?

1	Trust me, it's what I do.He's hiding something,

1	and we need to find out what that is.

1	I need you to do the same thing to him that he was going to do to you.

1	We'll enter his subconscious and find out what he doesn't want you to know.

2	All right.

1	He's out.

3	Wait, whose subconscious are we going into exactly?

1	We're going into Fischer's.

1	But I told him it was Browning's, so he can be a part of our team.

4	He's gonna help us break into his own subconscious.

1	That's right.

3	The security's gonna run you down, huh?

4	Then I will lead them on a merry chase.

3	Just be back before the kick.

4	Go to sleep, Mr. Eames.

4	Are you good?

4	Hey! Are you alright?

1	Yes, yes, I'm... I'm fine. I'm ready.
